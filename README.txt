Topic 

As we were all sitting next to each other and that's when we started to discuss our common interests. It turned out that we share a love for stand-up comedy. So we started discussing about our favorite comedians and the best comedy specials we've seen on Netflix. From there, we began to recommending some comedians to one another. From there because of me, we started discussing about food.
